# Efficiency-Insight - Algorithm Complexity Analysis Project
AnalysisOfAlgorithms-CMPE300-Project1

## Introduction
Efficiency-Insight is a comprehensive study in the field of algorithm analysis focuses on analyzing, implementing, and empirically testing the time complexity of a specific algorithm as part of the CMPE 300 course. It includes the implementation of a specific algorithm in Python and measures its execution time across various cases—best, worst, and average. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical algorithm analysis and practical performance metrics.

## Algorithm Description
The core of the project involves an algorithm that processes a list of integers, each element of which can be 0, 1, or 2 with equal probability of each.. The algorithm's behavior varies based on these values, introducing differing levels of complexity. It includes conditional loops and recursive divisions to simulate complexity in operations. The project includes calculating theoretical time complexities and comparing these with actual execution times.
